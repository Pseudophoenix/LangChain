      "since it is a multi- aent platform first\n",
      "we need to understand what is agent. Uh\n",
      "so let's spend few minutes understanding\n",
      "what is agent and agentic AI and if you\n",
      "already know this fundamentals then you\n",
      "can skip this section and move to coding\n",
      "part. So what exactly is agent and\n",
      "agentic AI when you're using chat GPT\n",
      "behind the scene you have LLM as your\n",
      "main component. This LLM can be GPT\n",
      "claude Gemini anything. when you ask a\n",
      "question, it will generate answer based\n",
      "on the pre-trained knowledge that it\n",
      "has. That is why it's called generative\n",

      "from place A to B tomorrow? It won't be\n",
      "able to answer because it has a\n",

      "have a different question such as book\n",
      "me cheapest flight from New York to\n",
      "Delhi. And now if LLM has access to\n",
      "Xedia, it will call Expedia for that you\n",
      "know source A to source destination,\n",
      "source to destination and given date. It\n",
      "will then search for the flights. It\n",
      "will decide which is the cheapest one\n",
      "and then it will also book it. So here\n",
      "it's not like chat GPT like simple\n",
      "question and answer. It is actually\n",
      "taking action for you. Okay. And it will\n",
      "say okay flight booked. So this is\n",
      "called AI agent. Okay. AI agent is a\n",
      "program that takes inputs, thinks about\n",
      "it. It acts to complete a task using\n",
      "tools, memory and knowledge. The API\n",
      "that we are using Expedia is called\n",
      "tool. Okay. And it is autonomous.\n",
      "Autonomous means it is taking action for\n",
      "you but narrow task. Okay. So here see\n",
      "it's just simple flight booking. So it's\n",
      "a very narrow task. So if you think\n",
      "about it, it first searched for few\n",
      "flights. Let's say it found five\n",
      "flights. Then it decided which is the\n",
      "cheapest one. Let's say this is the\n",
      "cheapest one. So it decided that in\n",
      "autonomous fashion. Okay, it did not ask\n",
      "you. It decided that hey this is the\n",
      "cheapest flight and it also booked it.\n",
      "You see? So that is why we are saying it\n",
      "is autonomous. Okay. So that is your AI\n",
      "agent. Now you can expand this further\n",
      "and you can say book me a flight for my\n",
      "7-day trip to New Delhi in May and I\n",
      "personally like sunny weather. So I also\n",
      "have a requirement that the weather\n",
      "should be sunny all the days and flight\n",
      "budget is this no layover. Now LLM can\n",
      "take help of Xedia API for the flight\n",
      "information but it also wants to know\n",
      "the weather. So maybe for weather it\n",
      "calls acue weather or weather.com\n",
      "whatever API right Google weather etc\n",
      "and it will pull that information. So\n",
      "this llm can have access to multiple\n",
      "tools. Okay. So it is checking the\n",
      "weather first to find seven consecutive\n",
      "days in May where the weather is sunny\n",
      "and for those days it is comparing the\n",
      "airlines and finding a flight which is\n",
      "in your budget. And not only that, it\n",
      "can also go one step further and give\n",
      "you suggestions for hotel and airport\n",
      "taxi. If you have booked a flight from\n",
      "make my trip or Expedia, you will find\n",
      "this, right? They will also give\n",
      "suggestions. So then it will say okay\n",
      "flight booked from this date to this\n",
      "date, weather is sunny, I also have good\n",
      "suggestion. Okay, so this is a flight\n",
      "booking AI agent. You can also have a\n",
      "system with multiple agents. For\n",
      "example, you have flight booking agent\n",
      "but if you are not let's say if you're\n",
      "traveling to India, if you're not Indian\n",
      "citizen, you have to take visa, right?\n",
      "So you can have immigration AI agent\n",
      "which you can connect to your one drive.\n",
      "You can have your passport, your\n",
      "immigration document there and this LLM\n",
      "can access it and it can tell you that\n",
      "hey you don't need have a visa. Okay,\n",
      "forget about uh booking the flight\n",
      "ticket. You first need to get the visa.\n",
      "So the this system consists of multiple\n",
      "agents. It is doing multi-step\n",
      "reasoning. It has a multi-turn approach\n",
      "where it is calling multiple agents.\n",
      "Maybe agents are being called multiple\n",
      "times too. And it is multi-step\n",
      "planning. It is working on a complex\n",
      "goal autonomously. Okay, you just giving\n",
      "it a goal that okay book a flight\n",
      "ticket. But the system is checking your\n",
      "visa. It's like if you call a agent,\n",
      "right, travel agent, they will do all of\n",
      "this. So this is similar system and this\n",
      "is called agentic AI. Agentic AI is a\n",
      "system where one or more see one or more\n",
      "AI agents work autonomously often over\n",
      "long task. They might call LLM multiple\n",
      "times making decision using tools and\n",
      "calling even other agents to reach a\n",
      "goal and crew AI helps you build AI\n",
      "agents especially multi- aent system.\n",
      "Now there are a lot of other frameworks\n",
      "right Google ADK lang graph crew AI so\n",
      "what is the difference when should I use\n",
      "what if you're building lightweight fast\n",
      "agent let's say if you want a agent\n",
      "which performs really fast and if you\n",
      "want to build it quickly agno is the\n",
      "framework Google you will use if you\n",
      "want tight GCP integration okay let's\n",
      "say your company is in Google ecosystem\n",
      "and and you want to leverage Gemini and\n",
      "all that other ecosystem Google is good\n",
      "if you want graph-based stateful\n",
      "orchestration which is highly\n",
      "customizable, highly reliable agents\n",
      "then you use langraph and crewi is used\n",
      "for role based orchestration simple and\n",
      "less customization. Okay, as we write\n",
      "code you will know more you know the the\n",
      "power of all these different frameworks\n",
      "we have separate tutorials for agno lang\n",
      "graph etc. So you can try it out and one\n",
      "of the frameworks can work the best for\n",
      "your given use case. We are going to use\n",
      "PyCharm code editor. So you can install\n",
      "it for free by going to their website.\n",
      "By default is it is free forever and you\n",
      "also get one month pro included. Click\n",
      "on download all the common sense steps.\n",
      "The second thing you will install is UV\n",
      "package manager. This is an alternate to\n",
      "pip and it is very fast. Uh I love it.\n",
      "So just Google UV package manager and\n",
      "here I'm I'm having Windows. So on your\n",
      "Windows PowerShell just copy okay copy\n",
      "this command and run it. So you can just\n",
      "say powershell\n",
      "windows powershell okay and that command\n",
      "is copied and you can just run enter and\n",
      "it will install UV for you. The next\n",
      "step is to get Google Gemini key. We are\n",
      "using Gemini model throughout this uh\n",
      "video. If you want to use any other\n",
      "model APO, OpenAI etc feel free in\n",
      "Google just search get Gemini API key\n",
      "and when you go to this page you can\n",
      "click on go to Google studio get API key\n",
      "and create API key. It will ask you to\n",
      "pick a Google cloud project. So you all\n",
      "have probably Gmail ID using that you\n",
      "log in and create a Google cloud\n",
      "project. Okay. So just Google Google\n",
      "cloud project and go to the projects\n",
      "page and here you can create a project\n",
      "okay you can create a project it might\n",
      "ask you for billing details it won't\n",
      "charge you money I think it has certain\n",
      "free limits so don't worry and once you\n",
      "have created that project when you say\n",
      "create API key you will select that\n",
      "project and then it will generate the\n",
      "API key in that project and you will\n",
      "save that API key for your usage in in\n",
      "this crew AI tutorial Let's do project\n",
      "setup. I am in my command prompt. I\n",
      "usually store my code in C code\n",
      "directory. Here I will say UV in it and\n",
      "name of the folder. It can be anything.\n",
      "I will say let's say crew AI tutorial.\n",
      "Okay. And see it created that project.\n",
      "So here if you look at crew AI tutorial,\n",
      "it created the basic skeleton which I'm\n",
      "going to open in my PyCharm. So PyCharm\n",
      "is open. Uh we have different project\n",
      "open right now. But let me just say open\n",
      "and see core crew AI tutorial. Right. So\n",
      "select a folder and open it in a new\n",
      "window. A quick shout out to Bright Data\n",
      "for sponsoring this video. In agent AI\n",
      "systems, data is everything but\n",
      "accessing data on web can be\n",

      "video description below. Back to the\n",
      "course now. So, let me move this thing\n",
      "on side\n",
      "and here you can see the empty project.\n",
      "Okay, so it created the virtual\n",
      "environment. It also has this pi project\n",
      "toml file. Okay. So the way it works is\n",
      "if you want to install any new package,\n",
      "usually you do like pip install\n",
      "something, right? But here you will do\n",
      "let's say UV add crew\n",
      "AI tools. So we are going to use this\n",
      "module crew AI tools for later usage. So\n",
      "I'll just say UV add and see it is Rust\n",
      "based framework. It is so fast. So it\n",
      "will resolve all the dependencies and it\n",
      "will add all those packages in your\n",
      "local environment. So that virtual\n",
      "environment that you you're seeing see\n",
      "it added all of this and it also updated\n",
      "this pi project toml file. See I did not\n",
      "update it automatically updated it and\n",
      "it has added now if you look at it see\n",
      "all this package are kind of added and\n",
      "you can see them in UV just in case if\n",
      "you are curious right in uv.log log file\n",
      "you will be able to see all those uh\n",
      "packages. Okay, you also need to\n",
      "configure your interpreter. So here um\n",
      "for this project okay let me just open I\n",
      "think here it's indexing uh you you see\n",
      "it is kind of indexing everything and\n",
      "you will get a chance to configure your\n",
      "interpreter here. One thing you want to\n",
      "make sure is that your Python\n",
      "interpreter is from this v environment\n",
      "directory here. If you go to scripts,\n",
      "you will see a file called python.exe\n",
      "and that should be your current\n",
      "interpreter. So if you go to settings\n",
      "here and if you just type python\n",
      "interpreter here, you see I have that\n",
      "particular file. If you expand this,\n",
      "this is crew tutorial v environment\n",
      "scripts python.exe. And if that is not\n",
      "the case, you can add a local\n",
      "interpreter and you can add it there.\n",
      "Okay. By default, it will do it\n",
      "automatically, I'm assuming. Now, we are\n",
      "going to build our first agent. So,\n",
      "let's create a Jupyter notebook here.\n",
      "And we will build an agent that can help\n",
      "you uh write better professional emails.\n",
      "Okay. So, we'll call it email agent.\n",
      "And here you will uh use Gemini API key.\n",
      "So you need to create this dot\n",
      "environment file. So just right click\n",
      "save file and just say dot environment.\n",
      "Okay. And when you have created that\n",
      "file you will specify your Gemini API\n",
      "key. So whatever your key is just copy\n",
      "paste it here. And then to load that API\n",
      "key you will use the environment Python\n",
      "module. So from\n",
      "dot environment\n",
      "import load dot environment and just\n",
      "call that function. Okay. and control\n",
      "hit enter and it will run it. Then you\n",
      "will import lm. So from crew AI import\n",
      "lm. Let's just do basic testing if you\n",
      "are able to call simple llm here or not.\n",
      "So this llm is going to be let me just\n",
      "copy paste code to save some time here.\n",
      "So you're using gemini model temperature\n",
      "is that creativity parameter and you're\n",
      "asking simple question okay who invented\n",
      "transcendental meditation? Now I have\n",
      "seen that the first call usually takes\n",
      "long time. I don't know what is the\n",
      "reason but if it takes even like 20 30\n",
      "seconds just just have patience and see\n",
      "our basic setup of API key etc is okay\n",
      "because you are able to call Gemini and\n",
      "get the answer. Now let's use crew AI to\n",
      "build an agent. So from crew AI you will\n",
      "import agent you will also import task\n",
      "and crew. So in crew you have to always\n",
      "create the crew. You can't just build an\n",
      "agent and run it. Okay. So that's the\n",
      "design of this uh particular framework\n",
      "and the email assistant. Okay. I will\n",
      "call it email assistant agent.\n",
      "So this expects couple of parameter.\n",
      "First one is role. Okay.\n",
      "Then comes the goal like what is the\n",
      "goal of this email assistant? And then\n",
      "comes backstory.\n",
      "Okay. Now you might have noticed in\n",
      "order to use chat GPT effectively\n",
      "sometimes you give backtory that hey you\n",
      "are an experienced mental therapist help\n",
      "me with this question. Hey you are an\n",
      "experienced data analyst help with this\n",
      "question. Okay. So you specify all those\n",
      "parameters here. So you'll say a highly\n",
      "experienced communication expert skilled\n",
      "in professional email writing. The goal\n",
      "is to improve emails and make them sound\n",
      "professional and clear. Okay. So this is\n",
      "your prompt engineering part folks. By\n",
      "providing these three parameters you're\n",
      "giving lot of details what role it\n",
      "should assume, what is the goal of this\n",
      "particular agent and what is their\n",
      "context that their backstory. You're\n",
      "specifying all of that. Okay. and then\n",
      "verbose true which means it will show\n",
      "you the detail calls and llm we are\n",
      "using this llm object that we created\n",
      "here. Okay. So this is how you create an\n",
      "email assistant. Now let's say you have\n",
      "this particular email that you want to\n",
      "improve. See this is very rough email.\n",
      "Hey team just wanted to tell you you see\n",
      "it's like rough email even everything is\n",
      "in a small case and and there are\n",
      "abbreviation like okay WIP\n",
      "you can't send this kind of email to\n",
      "your client so you have to add some\n",
      "professionalism to this email and for\n",
      "this you're going to specify a task now\n",
      "okay so first you specify agent then you\n",
      "specify task then you specify your crew\n",
      "so email task. Let me just create\n",
      "directly here. So you're using this task\n",
      "object and here uh okay here you will\n",
      "specify what agent. So for this task you\n",
      "want to use the email agent that you\n",
      "created and the description is that take\n",
      "the following rough email and rewrite it\n",
      "in a professional and polished version\n",
      "and also expand abbreviation. You can\n",
      "give extra instructions like wip is work\n",
      "in progress. Okay. And you're using\n",
      "Python format string. So you are\n",
      "specifying the actual email as well. And\n",
      "expected output says that a professional\n",
      "written output. So this is the\n",
      "instruction on what kind of output.\n",
      "Sometimes you want output to be in a\n",
      "JSON format in a table format. Okay. So\n",
      "that's just the expected uh output\n",
      "instruction. Once the task is specified,\n",
      "you will create a crew. You will say\n",
      "okay this is my crew.\n",
      "And see a crew can have multiple agents.\n",
      "Right now we have only one agent which\n",
      "is this which is fine. And then you will\n",
      "specify task. You can have multiple task\n",
      "by the way. You know you can have\n",
      "multiple task 1 2 3. If you want to do\n",
      "it in sequence you specify task one task\n",
      "two etc. In our case just one task. So\n",
      "let's specify that. And verbose is true\n",
      "which means it will print more output.\n",
      "And then you will just say crew dot\n",
      "kickoff\n",
      "and whatever result you are getting\n",
      "you will print the result. Okay. So\n",
      "let's run this cell. So see it started\n",
      "the execution and the task is this.\n",
      "Okay. And here is the final answer. Look\n",
      "at this email looks much more\n",
      "professional. Dear team, I'm writing\n",
      "whatever and it expanded on WIP\n",
      "abbreviation. Okay, work in progress.\n",
      "See, we gave that instruction remember\n",
      "expand abbreviation. So, it did that.\n",
      "Okay, so task completion\n",
      "and this is the output. All right,\n",
      "hooray. We just created our first basic\n",
      "agent in Crew AI. Now, let's add tool\n",
      "usage in this agent. The agent is\n",
      "working fine for common abbreviations\n",
      "like this. But sometimes you have\n",
      "company specific abbreviation. We have\n",
      "this AI services company called Atlique\n",
      "Technologies. And in my company uh we\n",
      "have different teams, different client\n",
      "projects and per project or per\n",
      "technical architecture there might be\n",
      "abbreviation that people use such as TAS\n",
      "technical architecture ST DBX you know\n",
      "all these abbreviations are very private\n",
      "to this organization. So general LLM\n",
      "which is trained on internet data will\n",
      "not have any idea on uh what this means.\n",
      "So let's say if you have an email that\n",
      "looks something like this. So original\n",
      "email is looping in Priya TS and PRX\n",
      "updates are in the DAC ETA whatever. I\n",
      "mean if you want to expand it you have\n",
      "to provide this company specific\n",
      "abbreviations uh as a tool to your LLM.\n",
      "So we are going to build that custom\n",
      "tool. Okay. So just copy paste Ctrl Ctrl\n",
      "+ V uh this particular notebook and\n",
      "let's call it\n",
      "email agent with tool\n",
      "and here I'll just run this code I think\n",
      "this cell is not needed so let's delete\n",
      "it and the original email here will be\n",
      "this\n",
      "okay so this is the email well we need\n",
      "that LLM code actually. So here I'm\n",
      "going to add\n",
      "in the code I will add this. So let's\n",
      "create an LLM at least. And once LLM is\n",
      "created, you are creating email\n",
      "assistant.\n",
      "Then you have email task and so on. Now\n",
      "let me take this email into a cell here\n",
      "and I'm going to build a tool. Okay. So\n",
      "we have to build a custom tool because\n",
      "readyate tool cannot be used here. So\n",
      "from crew AI\n",
      "import\n",
      "something called base tool. Actually\n",
      "it's from crew AI dot tools. Okay. And\n",
      "you are creating a class which is\n",
      "basically replacing your jargon. You\n",
      "know all these abbreviations are jargon.\n",
      "And even Elon Musk I think once he sent\n",
      "an email to all his Tesla employees that\n",
      "don't use jargon. Don't use abbreviation\n",
      "try to expand it. So in that spirit we\n",
      "are creating a replace jargon tool which\n",
      "is derived based from a base tool. So\n",
      "this is how you create a tool that can\n",
      "replace all those jargon and in this you\n",
      "have to provide a name of the tool\n",
      "right. So name and if you want to\n",
      "provide type in you can just say str\n",
      "then description which is replace jargon\n",
      "with more specific items and here you\n",
      "can see that see it it is autocomp\n",
      "completing because of the AI assistant\n",
      "that you have. So here if you not\n",
      "enabled AI assistant you can click and\n",
      "enable it you get uh 1 month free by\n",
      "default. Okay. So in the tool that I'm\n",
      "creating, we will have name description\n",
      "and we will have a function called run.\n",
      "Okay. So you are taking the body of the\n",
      "email as as an input and the output.\n",
      "This is how you specify the output\n",
      "string, right? The other uh string, the\n",
      "formatted email. So the jargon that we\n",
      "have, I'm going to specify them as this\n",
      "dictionary. Okay. So in this dictionary\n",
      "you have the expansion of all the jargon\n",
      "and I'm I'll just copy paste the code\n",
      "folks. So I I'll just say okay in the\n",
      "email essentially what you're doing is\n",
      "you're converting email to lower case\n",
      "and then uh in the email whenever you\n",
      "are finding that particular jargon you\n",
      "are just replacing you're saying\n",
      "consider replacing this jargon with this\n",
      "replacement. Okay. So it's a simple for\n",
      "loop that we wrote. And in order to test\n",
      "this uh what you can do is uh let's\n",
      "create\n",
      "the jargon tool\n",
      "and then JT dot I think you you can just\n",
      "say JT.\n",
      "And original email.\n",
      "Okay. Just I'm just testing the tool\n",
      "before I use it in my agent. So let's\n",
      "execute this cell. Control enter.\n",
      "See here it is saying consider replacing\n",
      "PRX with this. Consider replacing TAS\n",
      "with this. So the tool is working. Okay.\n",
      "And now all you need to do is specify\n",
      "the tool in your email assistant. You\n",
      "can specify it in task also. But here\n",
      "there is an argument called tools. And\n",
      "in tools you will specify JT because\n",
      "that is your uh tool. Okay. So take the\n",
      "following. I think we are good to go\n",
      "now. We can run this code. So once again\n",
      "we are taking professional email writing\n",
      "help and we want to improve this email\n",
      "and we are using all this abbreviation\n",
      "expansion which is very specific private\n",
      "data to my organization.\n",
      "All right let's see. So it is running\n",
      "and look at this agent tool execution.\n",
      "So when it realize that it needs to use\n",
      "this tool, it will use it. So it will\n",
      "use its sense of judgment. It's not like\n",
      "it uses this tool all the time. It knows\n",
      "that now I'm expanding this email and\n",
      "there are abbreviation and for\n",
      "abbreviations I can take help of this\n",
      "particular tool. So it calls that\n",
      "particular tool and see this is the tool\n",
      "input. So tool input is the email tool\n",
      "output is this. So now you got this text\n",
      "uh as an output from tool. That text\n",
      "goes back to your LLM and LLM will use\n",
      "that help to formalize the email. Okay.\n",
      "So see it will look something like this.\n",
      "So you have your\n",
      "uh LLM here correct? So this is your LLM\n",
      "and LLM is having access to this jargon\n",
      "tool. Right? So this is jargon tool.\n",
      "Now when you provide this email\n",
      "it will say okay T means this WIP means\n",
      "this etc. And LLM will take this input\n",
      "and it will use it to write a\n",
      "professional email. It's not like it's\n",
      "just copy pasting dumping it here. LLM\n",
      "is smart. So it is consuming it and\n",
      "understanding it and then writing the\n",
      "email. Okay. So this is the output it\n",
      "got and then now look at the final email\n",
      "including Priya in this email updates on\n",
      "technical architecture stack and project\n",
      "phonics. See what was my original email?\n",
      "Well my original email this TAS and PRX\n",
      "but it expanded it to that. So just\n",
      "folks run it. This is so beautiful. We\n",
      "just created our own custom tool by\n",
      "following this. Now this is the\n",
      "convention that they have right you have\n",
      "to derive a class based on base tool and\n",
      "then you need to have the name\n",
      "description and run is the main function\n",
      "that it will execute while making that\n",
      "tool call. Let us now work on building\n",
      "multiple agents and a crew. The problem\n",
      "statement we are going to look at is say\n",
      "you are writing a blog. Okay. Usually\n",
      "what happens is there is one person who\n",
      "is a researcher.\n",
      "So let's say there is this person who is\n",
      "a researcher. So they will go to\n",
      "internet okay internet do all the\n",
      "research and let's say the topic on\n",
      "which you are writing a blog is the\n",
      "future of EV vehicles okay future of EV\n",
      "vehicles.\n",
      "So let's say you are in Times of India,\n",
      "CNN, you are writing this blog. Usually\n",
      "in that company there will be a\n",
      "researcher who will go through internet,\n",
      "who will go through some private\n",
      "sources, who will interview people and\n",
      "get all the research done. So they will\n",
      "have all the research document. Let's\n",
      "say they create this research document.\n",
      "Then there is a second person who is a\n",
      "creative writer. So they will consume\n",
      "all this row research and write a very\n",
      "beautiful article you know beautiful\n",
      "user consumable article. So we are going\n",
      "to create one agent for researcher one\n",
      "agent for writer then this will be a\n",
      "crew. Okay. So my crew will be my\n",
      "research agent and creative writer and\n",
      "then we will give it a topic and it will\n",
      "write a blog. So let's create a Jupyter\n",
      "notebook here and let's say you call it\n",
      "a crew and here I will do some copy\n",
      "paste business because copy paste is the\n",
      "very very powerful skill or a weapon\n",
      "that you can have and uh okay use same\n",
      "Gemini model and then from crew this is\n",
      "like pretty much same agent task and\n",
      "crew from crew AI right you're importing\n",
      "this and just to save one time I will\n",
      "just do copy paste here so the first\n",
      "agent is research specialist you provide\n",
      "it goal okay research interesting facts\n",
      "about the topic and when you want topic\n",
      "to be dynamic you specify in a angle\n",
      "bracket like this and when you do crew\n",
      "do kickoff to give the actual task at\n",
      "that time you'll be able to specify the\n",
      "topic we will see how it works Okay,\n",
      "remaining things are kind of same. Then\n",
      "the writer agent, you are specifying\n",
      "these three things are important\n",
      "basically. Okay, you are creative\n",
      "writer, writer s blog, whatever you are\n",
      "skilled at writing this. Okay, so let's\n",
      "execute this. This is done. Now you\n",
      "specify your task. So you have two\n",
      "tasks, right? One is research task which\n",
      "you'll give to research agent. Second\n",
      "one is creative writing task which you\n",
      "will give it to uh creative writer. So\n",
      "let's uh do those tasks. So task one\n",
      "description find three to five\n",
      "interesting articles about this a bullet\n",
      "list of three to five facts. So you're\n",
      "just getting a bullet list of facts and\n",
      "then you're writing a 100word blog post\n",
      "about whatever and see here agent is\n",
      "research agent. Okay, here is agent is\n",
      "writer agent and in the context you can\n",
      "specify task one. So for context\n",
      "basically task two is dependent on task\n",
      "one. So that's why you are specifying\n",
      "this as a context and then crew is going\n",
      "to be the crew. You you notice that yeah\n",
      "assistant it just completed it knew what\n",
      "what I need to type in and it just did\n",
      "it for me. And then crew dot kickoff.\n",
      "Now here in the inputs you can specify a\n",
      "dictionary where you can say what is the\n",
      "topic\n",
      "and the topic is the future of uh\n",
      "electrical vehicles. So let's say\n",
      "control enter and run it. So agent\n",
      "started see research specialist it is\n",
      "running and it is finding the 3 to five\n",
      "interesting facts. So it found\n",
      "interesting facts based on his\n",
      "pre-trained knowledge. So you see data\n",
      "from 2023 2022 we are in 2025 by the way\n",
      "but we understand it doesn't have access\n",
      "to internet so whatever it is doing is\n",
      "is okay I mean it is up to our\n",
      "expectation and then it found five\n",
      "effects right 1 2 3 4 5 and that it will\n",
      "give it to the second agent which is\n",
      "creative writer and creative writer is\n",
      "writing 100 word blog out of it see so\n",
      "this is the\n",
      "final answer So this is the blog that\n",
      "you got. But as I said the problem here\n",
      "is uh we don't have the latest internet\n",
      "data\n",
      "and for that we can use one of the\n",
      "readym made tools in crew AI. Giving\n",
      "your crew an access to internet is\n",
      "actually very easy. Crew AI comes up\n",
      "with lot of readymade tools. Okay. Okay.\n",
      "So if you click on available QBI tools,\n",
      "see these are all the tools that it has\n",
      "and it has this ser dev tool which is um\n",
      "going to help it search the internet.\n",
      "Okay. So we are going to use that\n",
      "particular tool. So we just just just\n",
      "copy paste this code. But before that,\n",
      "let me just copy paste copy and create a\n",
      "copy of this and call it uh crew with\n",
      "with tools.\n",
      "Okay. And here we are going to import\n",
      "from crew AI tools serpool.\n",
      "Okay. Now, okay. Serper.\n",
      "So Serper is a platform that allows you\n",
      "to do Google search. So you need to get\n",
      "the API key for that. So just say serp\n",
      "I'm going to sign in with my Google\n",
      "account and they provide a certain\n",
      "access basically. So I created my own\n",
      "API key here. So just just create an API\n",
      "key and copy paste this key into your\n",
      "environment file. All right. So in your\n",
      "environment file you will say server API\n",
      "key. You mention your key here. your key\n",
      "whatever the key and Gemini API key is\n",
      "also your key. Okay, once this is done,\n",
      "you want to provide access of this to\n",
      "your research agent, right? Because\n",
      "research agent is searching the\n",
      "internet. So, tools serv tool. Okay, now\n",
      "let's run the code and see what happens.\n",
      "So, control entertrl\n",
      "entertuning.\n",
      "So here maybe in the description I will\n",
      "say uh find interesting recent facts uh\n",
      "as of the year 2025. Okay. So let me uh\n",
      "do this now. And you see now agent tool\n",
      "execution it is searching the internet\n",
      "with server. So that is what I wanted\n",
      "that it should search the internet and\n",
      "in the tool output it is finding all\n",
      "these parameters. See uh it is going\n",
      "through internet and it is looking at\n",
      "some articles. So let's say look at this\n",
      "particular article. Okay. So if you look\n",
      "at this particular article, it is just\n",
      "doing Google search and this article is\n",
      "June 2025, right? It's like I think last\n",
      "month only right now in July June. So\n",
      "it's going through internet scrapping\n",
      "internet\n",
      "scrapping all those articles and\n",
      "providing this tool output to LLM. Now\n",
      "llm in our crew see the the execution is\n",
      "something like this. Let me just uh show\n",
      "you. So you have your research agent\n",
      "right? So you have your\n",
      "research\n",
      "agent. It is accessing internet and\n",
      "serer tool is giving it some kind of\n",
      "block text block with all the latest\n",
      "article. Okay. then it will consume it\n",
      "and it will process it and it will pass\n",
      "that processed information\n",
      "back to the second agent which is writer\n",
      "agent. Now writer has all that latest\n",
      "information and it will be able to write\n",
      "a beautiful blog. Okay. So here this\n",
      "tool output is here. It went to your\n",
      "research specialist and the final answer\n",
      "is this. I think the and so see this is\n",
      "the final answer from research\n",
      "specialist. So it is this this\n",
      "particular block. It is not the final\n",
      "final answer. Okay. Is it agent's final\n",
      "answer? Then it gives it to the second\n",
      "agent which is creative writer and\n",
      "creative writer will write. Okay. The\n",
      "electric exchange with see 10.49 keer\n",
      "16.2 say 16.2 all that information that\n",
      "research agent accumulated it is using\n",
      "it to write the final blog. How cool is\n",
      "that right? So just access a crew AI for\n",
      "all the available tools here and it\n",
      "makes writing agents uh so easy. Let's\n",
      "think what can make a tool a good tool.\n",
      "So in order for tool to be a good tool,\n",
      "it should use caching whenever needed.\n",
      "So let's say you have an LLM,\n",
      "it is calling a tool and this tool is\n",
      "retrieving records from a database. Now\n",
      "let's say if this records are static, if\n",
      "it can use some cache like a radius\n",
      "cache or something, then it doesn't have\n",
      "to hit the database or API too often. So\n",
      "that way performance can be improved.\n",
      "Okay. So caching is one good quality of\n",
      "a tool. Second, it should be fault\n",
      "tolerant. Fall tolerant means let's say\n",
      "it doesn't have access to this database.\n",
      "It should know where to fall back. It\n",
      "should have some good error handling.\n",
      "Okay. Let's say it goes to some backup\n",
      "database and and gives you the records.\n",
      "It should have some retry mechanism. It\n",
      "should not be like okay it just crashes\n",
      "or it just gives like a random error\n",
      "response. Third thing it should be\n",
      "versatile. Versatile as in LLM gives\n",
      "input in different formats you know in\n",
      "challenging formats. Tool should be able\n",
      "to handle those. So whoever is writing\n",
      "the tool you have to take care of all\n",
      "these parameters. Then the question\n",
      "comes okay what makes an agent a good\n",
      "agent right? So\n",
      "if you want to build a good agent then\n",
      "the first thing is role play. See we are\n",
      "specifying this roleplay parameter. So\n",
      "now you can say okay you are an expert\n",
      "analyst. You can say you are a data\n",
      "analyst. See let's say you're doing some\n",
      "data analysis task.\n",
      "You can say you are a data analyst or\n",
      "you can say you are a senior data\n",
      "analyst with expertise in PowerBI.\n",
      "See these two things will make a big\n",
      "difference actually because you are\n",
      "setting the context right. You are\n",
      "asking it to assume a certain role.\n",
      "Second thing is which makes agents\n",
      "powerful and capable is tools. Once you\n",
      "provide it an access of tools which\n",
      "satisfies those three criterias that we\n",
      "specified agents become more powerful.\n",
      "Then comes memory. Okay. Memory is like\n",
      "you are having chat GPD like\n",
      "conversation. It's able to remember like\n",
      "short-term memory, long-term memory.\n",
      "That makes tool more powerful because it\n",
      "knows the context. It knows your\n",
      "preference. It knows you know what you\n",
      "have asked before. Then guard rails. So\n",
      "agents are like monkeys. You can't give\n",
      "them a password of your bank. You have\n",
      "to put certain guardies. Okay. So let's\n",
      "say if this is my agent, it needs to\n",
      "have certain boundary. It can manure\n",
      "around in this boundaries but it should\n",
      "not be able to go out. So those guard\n",
      "rails we need to uh specify. And then\n",
      "comes collaboration. Okay. See crew AI\n",
      "is a orchestration framework. They\n",
      "encourage creating multiple agents. Each\n",
      "agent focusing on a specific task.\n",
      "Therefore, if you can collaborate well\n",
      "with other agents, overall output is\n",
      "going to be better. So, these are the\n",
      "five characteristics\n",
      "uh that makes any agent a good agent.\n",
      "Okay. Now, so far you might have\n",
      "realized when we write this code, there\n",
      "is lot of prompt engineering. See, we\n",
      "are providing all these instructions,\n",
      "right? Ro, goal, backstory. Then in the\n",
      "task also description expect there is\n",
      "lot of text lot of instructions lot of\n",
      "guiding that you're doing for LLM\n",
      "wouldn't it be uh good if we can specify\n",
      "see if you can move all these\n",
      "instructions out of this code into some\n",
      "configuration file and then code is just\n",
      "writing code code should not have all\n",
      "this prompt engineering so if you move\n",
      "it in a different file the benefit you\n",
      "get it is whenever you want to change\n",
      "your prompt you change it from that file\n",
      "you you don't have to modify your code\n",
      "and that way you're doing loose coupling\n",
      "which will be creating less bugs in the\n",
      "future. Luckily, Crew AI provides an\n",
      "amazing way of specifying all these uh\n",
      "instructions in a YAML file. Okay, so\n",
      "the way it works is you create a\n",
      "directory. Okay, let's call it config.\n",
      "In that you create a file called\n",
      "agentsy.\n",
      "YL is a file format by the way. uh if\n",
      "you have done programming you'll know\n",
      "and then you can also create another\n",
      "file called tasksy\n",
      "and here essentially I I'll just copy\n",
      "paste you'll understand what I mean here\n",
      "see research agent whatever you are\n",
      "doing in research agent you specify all\n",
      "of that in this format so research agent\n",
      "is an agent colon then in the second one\n",
      "you specify which llm you want to use\n",
      "right so see here we were specifying llm\n",
      "here but in agents you just specify it\n",
      "here then roll so these are same\n",
      "instruction folks so ro whatever I have\n",
      "here is the same thing then goal this\n",
      "exact same thing I have here okay same\n",
      "way for writer agent and then for taskl\n",
      "again same thing see in task what were\n",
      "you specifying you were specifying\n",
      "description and expected output and the\n",
      "agent so here see description same thing\n",
      "expected output an agent will specify\n",
      "while we write the code. So now I'm\n",
      "going to create a new I'll create a\n",
      "regular file Python file and call it um\n",
      "let's say just YAML okay for the lake of\n",
      "uh better words\n",
      "and in this code u you will specify\n",
      "you will just import all this code right\n",
      "like crewi import this then crewi.\n",
      "We need this crew base class to\n",
      "read that YAML configuration\n",
      "and then from the tools you can import\n",
      "whatever tool is needed. Now here you\n",
      "will say at crew basease.\n",
      "So you are deriving a class from this\n",
      "crew base and you will say class blog\n",
      "crew and you will create class level of\n",
      "variables to declare agent config. So\n",
      "agent config is inside config directory\n",
      "agent.mml. Okay, this is the syntax\n",
      "folks. And then whatever agent you are\n",
      "creating you will annotate it with\n",
      "agent. Okay. So what is this agent?\n",
      "Well, this is researcher and the output\n",
      "of that is agent. Okay. So return agent\n",
      "and then you will specify your config\n",
      "file. So here the config is self dot\n",
      "aents config. Correct? self do.config.\n",
      "agents config and here you will specify\n",
      "the name of your research agent. Now if\n",
      "you're a Python programmer you'll be\n",
      "like okay this is an error because\n",
      "self.agentconfig Agent config is a\n",
      "string in that string you can't treat it\n",
      "like dictionary right and because of\n",
      "this annotations and because of the way\n",
      "this thing is designed this is going to\n",
      "work now there is an error uh that it is\n",
      "pointing and if you want to remove the\n",
      "error you can just put this so that way\n",
      "that error is gone but trust me this\n",
      "code is going to work okay and for the\n",
      "tools you are specifying servo tool and\n",
      "llm I think I you don't need to specify\n",
      "because because of this config See you\n",
      "specified llm here. So when you do this\n",
      "it will kind of get it. I think you can\n",
      "specify tools also but anyways I'm just\n",
      "feeling lazy not to move it there. And\n",
      "verbose is equal to true. Okay in\n",
      "similar fashion you can also write your\n",
      "other agent. Okay. So let's say that is\n",
      "your writer agent and in the agent\n",
      "config this writer agent is nothing but\n",
      "this.\n",
      "Similarly, specify the task as well. So,\n",
      "let me just specify the task\n",
      "research task, right? And it returns\n",
      "the task\n",
      "and the config is equal to self dot\n",
      "task config. And what is the task for\n",
      "research?\n",
      "Well, it is this task and your agent\n",
      "is self dot researcher. Make sure you're\n",
      "putting this brackets. Okay. So, and to\n",
      "remove this\n",
      "this this kind of you know error like\n",
      "when you put it you see this there was\n",
      "like a line uh which went away. Okay.\n",
      "Research task and block task you can\n",
      "specify in a similar fashion. Okay. Now\n",
      "you can specify your crew.\n",
      "So this is my crew and crew is nothing\n",
      "but you have two agents researcher and\n",
      "writer and you have two tasks research\n",
      "task and this task. Okay. Now\n",
      "let's do our main function. So blog crew\n",
      "is this and blog crew dot crew. Okay dot\n",
      "crew should be this dot kickoff. In the\n",
      "kickoff you will have inputs which is\n",
      "nothing but a topic and your topic is\n",
      "uh not Python the future of\n",
      "electrical\n",
      "vehicle. Okay. So let's right click run\n",
      "this.\n",
      "See it started and it called the tool.\n",
      "the tool or return the response\n",
      "and\n",
      "then there's a tool output that might\n",
      "take multiple return as well and a\n",
      "resource specialist final answer is this\n",
      "then it will start creative writer and\n",
      "then agent's final answer is this see it\n",
      "wrote this blog so essentially a coding\n",
      "wise see the final outcome is same it's\n",
      "just that we moved all that prompt\n",
      "engineering stuff into our sort of like\n",
      "configuration file. So tomorrow, let's\n",
      "say if you want to change this model,\n",
      "you just change it here. You don't have\n",
      "to update your code. And if you're done\n",
      "programming, you will know that when you\n",
      "do loose coupling like this where you're\n",
      "keeping instructions and configureration\n",
      "in a separate file and you're not\n",
      "modifying a code, you will have less\n",

      "Crew AI offers. Folks, so far whatever\n",
      "we have learned, we will use it to build\n",
      "a complete project using Crew AI. Let's\n",
      "imagine you are a SAS company which has\n",
      "built this product called Autoheet IQ\n",

      "Now there is a similar company called\n",

      "you want to build a social media or\n",
      "let's say marketing strategy so a head\n",
      "of marketing who is working for this uh\n",
      "startup will conduct a market research\n",
      "okay who are the competitors,\n",
      "who is our target audience, you know,\n",
      "where we should post uh and then they\n",
      "will build a marketing strategy.\n",
      "Sometimes if you're targeting Zenzi uh\n",
      "youngsters, you you have to go to\n",
      "Twitter uh or I think Instagram and uh\n",
      "Tik Tok, if you are targeting let's say\n",
      "45 plus age group, maybe you target\n",
      "Facebook. So you based on who is your\n",
      "target audience, you have to carefully\n",
      "design your marketing strategy and then\n",
      "you build something called a content\n",
      "calendar. Content calendar is nothing.\n",
      "It's a calendar of what kind of post you\n",
      "will make when. So let's say on 7:22 at\n",
      "10 I will make a post on LinkedIn. This\n",
      "is the topic you know and these are the\n",
      "key themes. So you have to build this\n",
      "kind of content calendar. In my own\n",
      "company code basics we also do this. We\n",
      "do market research. We build a content\n",
      "calendar. Then we use tools to automate\n",
      "the content and this task is done by\n",
      "marketing head. So let's say in our auto\n",
      "sheet IQ company marketing head is\n",
      "Reena. Okay, this person is our\n",
      "marketing head. She will do market\n",
      "research. Then she will uh build a\n",
      "market strategy and then she will create\n",
      "content calendar using a help of some\n",
      "some of her team member and then you\n",
      "will uh post drafts on LinkedIn,\n",
      "Twitter, wherever you want to post it.\n",
      "Okay. And you will also create uh\n",
      "scripts for reals and shorts. Okay. And\n",
      "this is done by content writer. uh\n",
      "usually in companies I have seen there\n",
      "is a separate content writer for social\n",
      "media and a different content writer for\n",
      "blog because blog is like a long form\n",
      "content. Okay. So let's say uh here he's\n",
      "Tony. Tony is the content writer\n",
      "especially for social media. So he's\n",
      "taking care of posting drafts. He's\n",
      "taking care of this and he's also\n",
      "actually helping Reena with the content\n",
      "calendar. And then comes content\n",
      "research for blogs because blogs is\n",
      "needed for SEO. SEO means search engine\n",
      "optimization. If someone is searching AI\n",
      "powered Excel, uh you want Google to\n",
      "promote your product, right? And for\n",
      "that you have to write lot of blogs. If\n",
      "you worked in SEO, you will understand\n",
      "and then you will draft the blogs. Okay?\n",
      "So let's say this work is done by Nancy.\n",
      "Nancy is a content writers specifically\n",
      "for blogs. Eventually you want to do SEO\n",
      "optimization and usually for SEO you\n",
      "have a person. So let's say we have Vun\n",
      "who is SEO specialist working in our\n",
      "company and his job is to optimize all\n",
      "the content for SEO and one of the thing\n",
      "that they do is they do keyword\n",
      "optimization. So they will figure out\n",
      "okay for our product which keywords are\n",
      "in hot demand. They will look at Google\n",
      "trends they will use many other tools to\n",
      "figure out all these uh keywords right.\n",
      "So see all these keywords and they put\n",
      "these keywords in their website as part\n",
      "of their SEO optimization. So if someone\n",
      "is searching for let's say GPTXL maybe\n",
      "your our auto sheet IQ website will pop\n",
      "up. They sometimes use the competitor's\n",
      "name as well. So if you're competitor\n",
      "you put it so that when someone is\n",
      "searching for competitor actually your\n",
      "website shows up. So this is all part of\n",
      "the uh SEO science. So to summarize in\n",
      "our crew when we are building a crew we\n",
      "will have four agents right marketing\n",
      "head content writer for social media\n",
      "content writer for blog and SEO\n",
      "specialist and we are going to perform\n",
      "all these task in a sequence okay\n",
      "eventually we will generate the draft\n",
      "for different posts. So see we have\n",
      "draft for email campaign we have a\n",
      "Facebook post, Instagram post, LinkedIn.\n",
      "Folks this is going to be intense. We\n",
      "are going to generate lot of post and we\n",
      "will also generate some other things for\n",
      "example keyword.txt\n",
      "then market research marketing strategy.\n",
      "This is going to be amazing uh complete\n",
      "project. Uh so I hope you got an idea on\n",
      "the problem statement. Let's start\n",
      "coding now. Let's create a separate\n",
      "folder here for our project. We are\n",
      "going to call it marketing\n",
      "crew. In this folder, I will also create\n",
      "another folder called config where we\n",
      "will put our agents.ml and task.ml.\n",
      "Okay, so let's create agents.ml\n",
      "and also task.ml task.ml.\n",
      "Now I can go ahead and write all my\n",
      "prompt for next 15 minutes or 20 minutes\n",
      "in front of you or I can use the power\n",
      "of copy paste. Okay. So I'm going to\n",
      "save your time and use the power of copy\n",
      "paste. So here uh the agent is basically\n",
      "we have four agents right like these\n",
      "four agents that we talked about. Who\n",
      "are the four agents by the way? these\n",
      "four marketing head content writer for\n",
      "social media for blog and SEO\n",
      "specialist. So see head of marketing,\n",
      "content writer for social media, for\n",
      "blog and SEO specialist and rest of the\n",
      "things is something we have done before\n",
      "right you specify your LLM what is the\n",
      "role head of marketing goal lead the\n",
      "marketing team to achieve specific goals\n",
      "whatever blah blah blah long text and\n",
      "you are an experienced marketing\n",
      "professional with a track record of\n",
      "leading successful marketing campaign\n",
      "see all these prompts are going to\n",
      "matter because LLM will derive context\n",
      "it will assume this role Right? Use a\n",
      "head of marketing. So all these things\n",
      "that specify is going to make an impact\n",
      "on your final output. Then content\n",
      "creator for social media. Right? You can\n",
      "read through it folks. Uh and you can\n",
      "modify it. Okay. For SEO specialist you\n",
      "have optimized the blogs and content for\n",
      "search engine blah blah blah. And for\n",
      "task we are going to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n",
      "eight different task folks. And once\n",
      "again I'm going to use the power of copy\n",
      "paste here. So the first task is market\n",
      "research. You see the market research.\n",
      "Okay. So what do you do in market\n",
      "research? Well conduct market research\n",
      "to identify trends, opportunities and\n",
      "challenges in the industry. Focus on\n",
      "customer needs, competitive strategies\n",
      "and market dynamics to inform marketing\n",
      "decisions. So this is how you can make\n",
      "your product name description dynamic.\n",
      "Okay. Here you have specified it sort of\n",
      "like a variable and also you will say\n",
      "current date in bracket current date. So\n",
      "it will perform market research as of\n",
      "the current date that you're running.\n",
      "And we will see in the code you know how\n",
      "you kind of tie these things together.\n",
      "Expected output is comprehensive market\n",
      "research report that includes this this\n",
      "this. Okay. Then you're building a\n",
      "marketing strategy for whatever product.\n",
      "And then you're building a content\n",
      "calendar. See here content calendar. And\n",
      "then you're preparing post draft and so\n",
      "on. Okay. So once again look through it.\n",
      "There is lot of text, lot of prompt\n",
      "engineering you have to do. Usually you\n",
      "will perform one task, run it, you will\n",
      "see it. But if I try to do that here,\n",
      "this is going to be 5 hour tutorial. So\n",
      "I'm just trying to save your time. Now\n",
      "let's create our crew.ai file. So crew\n",
      "dopy file. Okay. And here we'll do our\n",
      "initialization whatever we have done\n",
      "before. And here you can see that other\n",
      "than serp tool which is internet search\n",
      "we are importing some other tools also.\n",
      "Uh this tool scrap website tool will go\n",
      "and scrap any website. This will help\n",
      "you read a directory on your local disk.\n",
      "then this will help you read and write\n",
      "files etc. Okay,\n",
      "now let's create our crew class. So how\n",
      "do you create it? You have to derive it\n",
      "based on crew base, right? And then just\n",
      "specify your agents and taskm pretty uh\n",
      "obvious stuff. And then you specify your\n",
      "agent for your marketing manager, a head\n",
      "of marketing. So head of marketing is\n",
      "agents config head of marketing. So this\n",
      "thing is this right? Head of marketing\n",
      "this these strings should match and they\n",
      "are using Google because they have to do\n",
      "mark internet research. So they will use\n",
      "sererdev tool to search internet. Uh\n",
      "they will scrap websites. And then for\n",
      "directory read tool what we are going to\n",
      "do is see when this crew runs you will\n",
      "see a directory called resources. And\n",
      "resources will have another sub folder\n",
      "called drafts and those drafts will\n",
      "contain your LinkedIn post res and so\n",
      "on. Okay. So directory read tool helps\n",
      "you read that particular directory and\n",
      "file writer and file read tool will help\n",
      "you write and read files locally.\n",
      "Reasoning is equal to true which means\n",
      "it will act in a react like reasoning\n",
      "and action. Okay. And then inject that\n",
      "true means it will inject the current\n",

      "this term by the way is sometimes\n",

      "are there are actually two terms. Uh\n",
      "reactive.\n",
      "See reactive is what? Reactive is\n",

      "content writer for blog then SEO\n",
      "specialist\n",
      "and whatn not. Then you will write your\n",

      "there is not much code. It's all you\n",

      "say self.t agents it will take all the\n",
